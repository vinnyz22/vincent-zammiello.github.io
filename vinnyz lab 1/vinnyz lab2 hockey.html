<P1>Hockey has been a huge part in my life. It has consumed a majority of my time since I was five years old. I've played for several teams in different states and have played at rinks all over the country and i have nothing but positive things to say about my hockey experience. I am a huge Bruins fan and I'm very much looking forward to the upcoming season.</P1>
