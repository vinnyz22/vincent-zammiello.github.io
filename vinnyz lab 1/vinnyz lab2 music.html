My music taste is very diverse as I constantly am updating my library with new music. I listen to mostly rap with some types of rock and alternative. My favorite rappers consist of Travi$ Scott, Post Malone, Kanye West, Drake, A$AP Rocky, and Tyler, The Creator. However, Travi$ Scott is by far my favorite due to his lively shows and great flow in between verses. He has been rapping since 2008 but has just become popular in 2015. In just that short time he has produced several hits such as "Antidote" or "Goosebumps". He has two highly anticipated albums prepared to be released by the end of 2017. One solo album titled "Astroworld" and the other is a collaboration with Quavo, a member of the rap group Migos. His most recent tour with Kendrick Lamar the "DAMN" tour grossed nearly one million dollars per show, selling out huge stadium venues. Since rap has recently been declared the most popular genre of music in the U.S. it has given rappers a better opportunity than ever to create more music and go on tour. I've been to several concerts from venues such as the TD Garden, Gillette Stadium, and The Xfinity Center.</p>
